Hi! I am a Mexican Data Analyst with a social science background. This is my blog where I post the stuff I learn about Statistics, R, and Python but where I also explore some critical concerns about the uses of data in our world. My professional experience consists of making sense of social indicators and statistics. I am currently on the path to becoming a Data Scientist. I also make amazing tacos.
